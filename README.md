# *Chrowned* by an Extension: Abusing the Chrome DevTools Protocol through the Debugger API
This repository contains the artifacts for the aforementioned paper.
Each directory contains the files for a different Proof-Of-Concept Chromium
extension.
All extensions are written using the Manifest V3 specification.

## Getting Started
All sample extensions can be installed by either:
- Going to `chrome://extensions`, clicking on "Load Unpacked" and selecting
  the desired artifact directory.
- Packing the artifact directory contents as a ZIP archive and
  drag-and-dropping it into `chrome://extensions`.
